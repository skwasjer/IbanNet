# Changelog

## v5.7.0

- Move normalization to `IbanParser` from `IbanValidator`. This means that the validator is now validating 100% strict according to character pattern rules (character class, case and whitespace, etc.). `ValidationResult.AttemptedValue` will now also have the raw input. Whitespace/casing is still ignored by the `IbanParser`.
- Add Strict-property (default true) to `IbanAttribute` and `FluentIbanValidator` extension. When Strict=true, the input must strictly match the IBAN format rules. When Strict=false, whitespace is ignored and strict character casing enforcement is disabled (meaning, the user can input in lower and uppercase). This mode is a bit more forgiving when dealing with user-input. However it does require after successful validation, that you parse the user input with `IbanParser` to normalize/sanitize the input and to be able to format the IBAN in correct electronic format.
- When normalizing, carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) are no longer stripped.
- `IllegalCharactersResult` and `InvalidStructureResult` have a property `Position` which indicates the 0-based position at which the first invalid character was encountered.
- ~15-20% Performance improvements to pattern validator.

### IbanNet.FluentValidation

- Fix registration bug where if custom registry was registered, it would still additionally register IbanNet instead of ignoring.

## v5.6.2

- Regenerated Wikipedia registry which corrects IBAN pattern for Senegal (SN).
- Add code gen SWIFT CSV record patchers (so that this no longer requires manual work on each registry update)

## v5.6.1

- Adds branch information to FR (#78)

## v5.6.0

- LTS: dropped support for .NET 5.0
- Updated System.ComponentModel.Annotations to v5.0.0
- Updated Autofac to 6.4.0
- Updated FluentValidation to 11.1.0

## v5.5.1

- Upgraded SWIFT registry to May '22 release 92, which adds Djibouti (DJ), fixes the bank pattern for Bahrain (BH).
- Upgraded Wikipedia registry which corrects English name for Sao Tome (ST).

## v5.5.0

- Fixed SWIFT country definitions for which the 'included country codes' contained inferred locales. The list now actually contains the expected country codes.
- LTS: dropped support for .NET 4.5.2 and .NET Standard 1.2/1.3. Added .NET 4.6.2.

## v5.4.0

- Use new `Chunk()` LINQ API for .NET 6 and change own `Partition()` method into polyfill for older framework targets.
- Added `AcceptCountryRule` to restrict validation to a specific set of countries. The rule can be added via the validator options or dependency registration extensions.

## v5.3.2

- Change `master` branch to `main`, requiring update to CI scripts, and update all external page references.

## v5.3.1

- Add package README's

## v5.3.0

- Added .NET 6 target

## v5.2.0

- Added `IbanCountry.NativeName` property which returns the country name in native language, if available.
- Changed the `IbanCountry.DisplayName` property to return the native name, if available; otherwise returns the English name.
- Regenerated `WikipediaRegistryProvider` to include Sudan (SD).
- Implemented `IEquatable<T>`.
- Implemented `IFormattable` with format strings `E`, `P` and `O` for `Electronic`, `Print` and `Obfuscated` respectively.
- Upgraded registry to October '21 release 91 (added Burundi (BI) and updated Sudan (SD))

## v5.1.0

### IbanNet

- Added JSON converter support for `System.Text.Json` to the `Iban` type (>= .NET 5 only)
- Added `iban.IsQrIban()` extension method. A Swiss or Liechtenstein QR-IBAN must have a valid QR-IID, i.e. the bank number must be within the [30000, 31999] range.

## v5.0.0

### IbanNet

- Removed deprecated contracts/code `IStructureValidationFactory`, `IStructureValidation`, `IStructureSection`. Use the `Pattern` abstraction for custom registry providers.
- Removed `Iban.Parse`, `Iban.TryParse`, use the `IbanParser` class.
- Added support for [more countries](./SupportedCountries.md) based on Wikipedia.
- Removed `ValidationMethod`, since performance in strict (= default) is now significantly faster (compared to v4.x, even in loose mode). The maintenance is not worth the little gains anymore.
- Cleaned up API surface/sealed several types.
- Added `Country`, `Bban`, `BankIdentifier` and `BranchIdentifier` properties to the `Iban` value type.
- Removed obsolete facade for `SwiftRegistryProvider`.
- Upgraded registry to June '21 release 90 (added Sudan (SD))

### IbanNet.FluentValidation

- Updated to FluentValidation v10.x, dropping .NET 4.6.1.

### IbanNet.DependencyInjection.*

- `IIbanParser` and `IIbanGenerator` are now registered as singletons.
- Added `IIbanRegistry` as resolveable service (singleton).

## v4.4.3

- Moved `SwiftRegistryProvider` to new namespace, kept facade for backwards compatibility. The facade will be removed in v5.0.

## v4.4.2

- Deprecate loose validation mode. Will be removed in v5.0.

## v4.4.1

- `IIbanRegistry.TryGetValue` now supports case insensitive country codes.

## v4.4.0

- [#21](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/issues/21) [#31](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/pull/31) Added `IbanGenerator`.
- LTS: change target frameworks .NET 4.5 and 4.7 to 4.5.2 and 4.7.2 respectively.
- Fix Iraq (IQ) and Finland (FI) patterns (does not affect validation outcome).
-  Introduce pattern abstraction for registry which encapsulates a pattern string and tokenizer. Deprecates `IStructureValidationFactory`, but keeps backwards compatible. Patterns are useful when implementing more/future providers to extend country support.

## v4.3.1

- Upgraded registry to March '21 release 89 (updated Andorra (AD) and El Salvador (SV))

## v4.3.0

- Added .NET 5.0 target framework support ([benchmark](test/IbanNet.Benchmark/BenchmarkResults.md)).
- Update several nullable reference type code contracts.

### IbanNet.FluentValidation

- Updated to FluentValidation v9.x. This also means dropping support for .NETStandard 1.1/1.6 for FluentValidation integration.

### IbanNet.DependencyInjection.Autofac

- (breaking) Updated to Autofac v6.x (one Autofac [interface changed](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/commit/3a9ec6f43fac943476124065ddbd8cf93ccaede6))

## v4.2.0

- Upgraded registry to September '20 release 88 (added Libya (LY))
- Added `IbanBuilder` and `BbanBuilder` types.

## v4.1.0

### Changes

- IBAN's are now always converted to upper case prior to validation.
- Replaced `Iban.ToString(string)` with `Iban.ToString(IbanFormat)`, and added obfuscated format.

### Fixes

- [#19](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/issues/19) Parse should only allow non-nullable string.
- [#23](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/issues/23) AttemptedValue did not match actual value used in validation.
- [#24](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/issues/24) Structure test will ignore country code casing.

## v4.0.1

- Upgraded registry to May '20 release 87 (changes to ST)

## v4.0.0

### Improvements

- Added `IbanParser` which provides equivalent non-static functionality to `Iban.Parse` and `Iban.TryParse` (which will be obsolete).
- Added .NET Standard 2.1 target
- Enabled and refactored for non-nullable reference types.
- Added abstraction to load registry from different sources.
- Added `ICheckDigitsCalculator` abstraction.
- Exposing `IIbanValidationRule` allowing custom validation rules.
- [Performance improvements](test/IbanNet.Benchmark/BenchmarkResults-v4.x.md)

### Changes

- (breaking) `Iban.Parse` and `Iban.TryParse` are obsolete, use `IIbanParser`.
- (breaking) Added IbanValidator ctor overload accepting an `IbanValidatorOptions` class, providing options with validation method (strict = default vs loose), extensibility through custom rules.
- (breaking) Refactored out enum `IbanValidationResult`, replaced with result object pattern for extensibility.
- (breaking) `ValidationResult` now contains `Error`-property containing the error that occurred.
- (breaking) Remove deprecated TypeConverter facade.
- (breaking) Remove deprecated ctor (accepting `Lazy`).
- (breaking) `IbanValidator.SupportedCountries` now is a dictionary, allowing look up by country code.
- (breaking) Renamed `CountryInfo` to `IbanCountry`.
- (breaking) Renamed `ValidationResult.Value` to `ValidationResult.AttemptedValue`.
- (breaking) Moved `Branch` and `Bank` properties from `BbanStructure` to `IbanCountry` and all offsets are now relative to entire IBAN. This makes it easier to extract this data from an IBAN.
- (breaking) `IbanAttribute` no longer uses static `Iban.Validator` as fallback since it is unclear it does so. The `IIbanValidator` will now only be resolved from IoC container and as such if not registered an exception is thrown.
