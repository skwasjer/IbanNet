# Changelog

## Unreleased

- [#138](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/pull/138) Implement `IParsable<TSelf>` on Iban type.
- [#157](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/pull/157) Added extension to generate regex pattern from IBAN pattern.
- [#164](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/pull/164) Added a `RejectCountryRule` as the direct counterpart of `AcceptCountryRule`.

## v5.10.0

- Upgraded SWIFT registry provider to July '23 release 95, which adds Falkland Islands (FK).
- Upgraded Wikipedia registry provider, which adds North Macedonia (MK).
- [#144](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/pull/144) Add Catalan localization.
- In `IbanParser` internals, use `ReadOnlySpan<T>`.
- Add additional constructor overloads to `IbanValidator`, in preparation of possible deprecation of `IbanValidatorOptions`. Even if not deprecating, it is still convenient.

## v5.9.0

- Upgraded SWIFT registry to April '23 release 94, which adds Mongolia (MN) and Nicaragua (NI).
  - Importantly, the spec for Nicaragua seems to differ from what is listed on Wikipedia (28 vs 32 char length). The website of the [Central Bank of Nicaragua](https://www.bcn.gob.ni/sistemas-de-pagos/informacion_iban) confirms this.
  - Additionally the included example for Nicaragua does NOT validate and I had to resort to patching the example data.
  - the last updated timestamp of Georgia (GE) was also changed, because of an update to contact information in the spec (unused by IbanNet).

  > As with any new addition to the registry, some caution is advised and possibly changes are to be expected as I've seen such inaccuracies more often in the past.
- Refactored pattern tokenizer to support wide tokens (multi char), next to (single) char tokens. This is an internal change that can unlock some extra future functionality.
- Fix: the property `IbanRegistry.Providers` is made read-only after hydrating/using the registry to prevent it from being modified.

## v5.8.1

- Upgraded SWIFT registry to Feb '23 release 93, which adds Somalia (SO) and fixes some misconfiguration for Finland (FI) removing the need for 'some' patching (no regression).
- Updated Wikipedia provider, which updates validation patterns for Dominican Republic (DO), Georgia (GE), Ireland (IE), Jordan (JO), Pakistan (PK), Palestinian territories (PS), Turkey (TR), British Virgin Islands (VG) and Burundi (BI).

## v5.8.0

- Update `FluentValidation` to v11.3.0
- Updated Wikipedia registry provider which corrects the IBAN and BBAN pattern for Azerbaijan (AZ). The Swift registry (which is the default) was already correct, so there is no regression if you do not use the Wikipedia provider.
- [#116](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/pull/116) Added .NET 7 target framework support
- Performance improvements (10-20%):
  - Use `CollectionsMarshal.AsSpan` in some areas to improve enumeration perf
  - Use faster API's to change a `Span<char>` back to a `string`
  - Use new .NET 7 `char` API's and aggressive inline own `char` extensions
  - Rework `Pattern` lazy init to improve init time
  - When parsing, do not allocate and return a new copy of the input if no normalization was performed.

## v5.7.2

- Lazy initialization of `IbanRegistry` is now thread safe.
- Add ctor overload to `IbanGenerator` which enables specifying a seed for consistent, reproduceable generation.
- Enable deterministic build/assemblies

## v5.7.1

- [#97](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/pull/97) Add Dutch localized exception/result messages.

## v5.7.0

- Move normalization to `IbanParser` from `IbanValidator`. This means that the validator is now validating 100% strict according to character pattern rules (character class, case and whitespace, etc.). `ValidationResult.AttemptedValue` will now also have the raw input. Whitespace/casing is still ignored by the `IbanParser`.
- Add Strict-property (default true) to `IbanAttribute` and `FluentIbanValidator` extension. When Strict=true, the input must strictly match the IBAN format rules. When Strict=false, whitespace is ignored and strict character casing enforcement is disabled (meaning, the user can input in lower and uppercase). This mode is a bit more forgiving when dealing with user-input. However it does require after successful validation, that you parse the user input with `IbanParser` to normalize/sanitize the input and to be able to format the IBAN in correct electronic format.
- When normalizing, carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) are no longer stripped.
- `IllegalCharactersResult` and `InvalidStructureResult` have a property `Position` which indicates the 0-based position at which the first invalid character was encountered.
- ~15-20% Performance improvements to pattern validator.

### IbanNet.DependencyInjection.Autofac

- Fix registration bug where if custom registry was registered, it would still additionally register IbanNet instead of ignoring.

## v5.6.2

- Regenerated Wikipedia registry which corrects IBAN pattern for Senegal (SN).
- Add code gen SWIFT CSV record patchers (so that this no longer requires manual work on each registry update)

## v5.6.1

- Upgraded Wikipedia registry which corrects English name for Sao Tome (ST).

## v5.5.0

- Fixed SWIFT country definitions for which the 'included country codes' contained inferred locales. The list now actually contains the expected country codes.
- LTS: dropped support for .NET 4.5.2 and .NET Standard 1.2/1.3. Added .NET 4.6.2.

## v5.4.0

- Use new `Chunk()` LINQ API for .NET 6 and change own `Partition()` method into polyfill for older framework targets.
- Added `AcceptCountryRule` to restrict validation to a specific set of countries. The rule can be added via the validator options or dependency registration extensions.

## v5.3.2

- Change `master` branch to `main`, requiring update to CI scripts, and update all external page references.

## v5.3.1

- Add package README's

## v5.3.0

- Added .NET 6 target

## v5.2.0

- Added `IbanCountry.NativeName` property which returns the country name in native language, if available.
- Changed the `IbanCountry.DisplayName` property to return the native name, if available; otherwise returns the English name.
- Regenerated `WikipediaRegistryProvider` to include Sudan (SD).
- Implemented `IEquatable<T>`.
- Implemented `IFormattable` with format strings `E`, `P` and `O` for `Electronic`, `Print` and `Obfuscated` respectively.
- Upgraded registry to October '21 release 91 (added Burundi (BI) and updated Sudan (SD))

## v5.1.0

### IbanNet

- Added JSON converter support for `System.Text.Json` to the `Iban` type (>= .NET 5 only)
- Added `iban.IsQrIban()` extension method. A Swiss or Liechtenstein QR-IBAN must have a valid QR-IID, i.e. the bank number must be within the [30000, 31999] range.

## v5.0.0

### IbanNet

- Removed deprecated contracts/code `IStructureValidationFactory`, `IStructureValidation`, `IStructureSection`. Use the `Pattern` abstraction for custom registry providers.
- Removed `Iban.Parse`, `Iban.TryParse`, use the `IbanParser` class.
- Added support for [more countries](./SupportedCountries.md) based on Wikipedia.
- Removed `ValidationMethod`, since performance in strict (= default) is now significantly faster (compared to v4.x, even in loose mode). The maintenance is not worth the little gains anymore.
- Cleaned up API surface/sealed several types.
- Added `Country`, `Bban`, `BankIdentifier` and `BranchIdentifier` properties to the `Iban` value type.
- Removed obsolete facade for `SwiftRegistryProvider`.
- Upgraded registry to June '21 release 90 (added Sudan (SD))

### IbanNet.FluentValidation

- Updated to FluentValidation v10.x, dropping .NET 4.6.1.

### IbanNet.DependencyInjection.*

- `IIbanParser` and `IIbanGenerator` are now registered as singletons.
- Added `IIbanRegistry` as resolveable service (singleton).

## v4.4.3

- Moved `SwiftRegistryProvider` to new namespace, kept facade for backwards compatibility. The facade will be removed in v5.0.

## v4.4.2

- Deprecate loose validation mode. Will be removed in v5.0.

## v4.4.1

- `IIbanRegistry.TryGetValue` now supports case insensitive country codes.

## v4.4.0

- [#21](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/issues/21) [#31](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/pull/31) Added `IbanGenerator`.
- LTS: change target frameworks .NET 4.5 and 4.7 to 4.5.2 and 4.7.2 respectively.
- Fix Iraq (IQ) and Finland (FI) patterns (does not affect validation outcome).
-  Introduce pattern abstraction for registry which encapsulates a pattern string and tokenizer. Deprecates `IStructureValidationFactory`, but keeps backwards compatible. Patterns are useful when implementing more/future providers to extend country support.

## v4.3.1

- Upgraded registry to March '21 release 89 (updated Andorra (AD) and El Salvador (SV))

## v4.3.0

- Added .NET 5.0 target framework support ([benchmark](test/IbanNet.Benchmark/BenchmarkResults.md)).

### IbanNet.FluentValidation

- Updated to FluentValidation v9.x. This also means dropping support for .NETStandard 1.1/1.6 for FluentValidation integration.

### IbanNet.DependencyInjection.Autofac

- (breaking) Updated to Autofac v6.x (one Autofac [interface changed](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/commit/3a9ec6f43fac943476124065ddbd8cf93ccaede6))

## v4.2.0

- Upgraded registry to September '20 release 88 (added Libya (LY))
- Added `IbanBuilder` and `BbanBuilder` types.

## v4.1.0

### Changes

- IBAN's are now always converted to upper case prior to validation.
- Replaced `Iban.ToString(string)` with `Iban.ToString(IbanFormat)`, and added obfuscated format.

### Fixes

- [#19](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/issues/19) Parse should only allow non-nullable string.
- [#23](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/issues/23) AttemptedValue did not match actual value used in validation.
- [#24](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet/issues/24) Structure test will ignore country code casing.

## v4.0.1

- Upgraded registry to May '20 release 87 (changes to ST)

## v4.0.0

### Improvements

- Added `IbanParser` which provides equivalent non-static functionality to `Iban.Parse` and `Iban.TryParse` (which will be obsolete).
- Added .NET Standard 2.1 target
- Enabled and refactored for non-nullable reference types.
- Added abstraction to load registry from different sources.
- Added `ICheckDigitsCalculator` abstraction.
- Exposing `IIbanValidationRule` allowing custom validation rules.
- [Performance improvements](test/IbanNet.Benchmark/BenchmarkResults-v4.x.md)

### Changes

- (breaking) `Iban.Parse` and `Iban.TryParse` are obsolete, use `IIbanParser`.
- (breaking) Added IbanValidator ctor overload accepting an `IbanValidatorOptions` class, providing options with validation method (strict = default vs loose), extensibility through custom rules.
- (breaking) Refactored out enum `IbanValidationResult`, replaced with result object pattern for extensibility.
- (breaking) `ValidationResult` now contains `Error`-property containing the error that occurred.
- (breaking) Remove deprecated TypeConverter facade.
- (breaking) Remove deprecated ctor (accepting `Lazy`).
- (breaking) `IbanValidator.SupportedCountries` now is a dictionary, allowing look up by country code.
- (breaking) Renamed `CountryInfo` to `IbanCountry`.
- (breaking) Renamed `ValidationResult.Value` to `ValidationResult.AttemptedValue`.
- (breaking) Moved `Branch` and `Bank` properties from `BbanStructure` to `IbanCountry` and all offsets are now relative to entire IBAN. This makes it easier to extract this data from an IBAN.
- (breaking) `IbanAttribute` no longer uses static `Iban.Validator` as fallback since it is unclear it does so. The `IIbanValidator` will now only be resolved from IoC container and as such if not registered an exception is thrown.
